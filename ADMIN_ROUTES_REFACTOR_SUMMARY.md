# Admin Routes Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Authentication System Integration
- **Before**: Admin routes used DirectusCrud dependencies that were causing import conflicts
- **After**: All admin routes now use the stable `checkAdminRights` function that works with existing authentication

### 2. Route Implementations Fixed

#### `/api/admin/users` (GET)
- Uses `checkAdminRights` for admin verification
- Makes direct axios calls to Directus API with admin token
- Returns user list with proper error handling

#### `/api/admin/users/:userId` (PATCH)
- Validates admin permissions before allowing user updates
- Uses environment admin token for database operations
- Supports updating: `is_smm_admin`, `expire_date`, `status`

#### `/api/admin/users/activity` (GET)
- Provides user activity statistics
- Calculates metrics: total users, active today/week/month, admins, expired, suspended
- Returns both stats and user list (limited to 50 recent users)

### 3. Security Improvements
- All routes properly validate JWT tokens
- Admin privilege verification before any operations
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access
- Uses secure admin token for database operations

### 4. Code Quality
- Removed problematic DirectusCrud dependencies
- Consistent error handling across all routes
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Clean separation of concerns

## Test Results
- Authentication validation working correctly
- Admin privilege checking functional
- Routes properly reject invalid/expired tokens
- Error handling provides appropriate responses
- System maintains security while providing admin functionality

## Integration
- Routes are integrated into main router via `/server/routes.ts`
- Compatible with existing authentication middleware
- Uses same token validation as other protected routes
- Maintains consistency with project architecture

The admin routes are now stable, secure, and fully integrated with the existing authentication system.
