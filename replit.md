## Recent Changes
- **2025-08-01**: **FULLY RESTORED MODULAR ROUTES AFTER REFACTORING** - Fixed critical bug in all modular route files where Directus API responses were incorrectly parsed. Issue: code expected direct field access but Directus returns `{data: {...}}` structure. Applied systematic fix to auth.ts, campaigns.ts, keywords.ts, trends.ts, stories.ts. Authentication and all API endpoints now working correctly.
- **2025-08-01**: **RESOLVED CRITICAL APPLICATION LOADING ISSUE** - Diagnosed and fixed React application crash that caused "app not running" error in Replit. Issue was traced to React component compilation problems and complex import dependencies. Solution involved systematic isolation using static HTML fallback, confirming server functionality, then gradual restoration of React components. Application now loads correctly in both development and production environments.
- **2025-08-01**: **COMPLETED ROUTES REFACTORING WITH FULL RECOVERY** - Successfully implemented and restored modular architecture after compilation crisis. Extracted 5 core modules (auth, campaigns, keywords, trends, stories) with comprehensive error handling. Fixed 96+ TypeScript compilation errors including missing functions (normalizeSourceUrl, translateToEnglish, deleteRelatedItems). All modular routes now working perfectly with proper authentication responses.
- **2025-08-01**: **COMPLETED TRENDS SOURCE RATING SYSTEM** - Fixed source rating display to properly read from sentiment_analysis field, system now correctly shows emoji ratings (üòä, üòê, etc.) based on saved analysis data instead of "Analyze" buttons
- **2025-08-01**: **FIXED FACEBOOK PAGE TOKEN RETRIEVAL** - Corrected Facebook OAuth to properly fetch and use individual page access tokens instead of user tokens for publishing
- **2025-08-01**: **CORRECTED FACEBOOK TOKEN STRUCTURE** - Fixed Facebook OAuth to properly store page token in main "token" field and handle Instagram token separately according to user specification
- **2025-08-01**: **FIXED TREND COLLECTION USER NOTIFICATIONS** - Added immediate "S–±–æ—Ä –Ω–∞—á–∞—Ç" notification when trend collection starts, delayed helpful tips by 60 seconds

- **2025-08-01**: **IMPLEMENTED COMPREHENSIVE TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE** - Created extensive Jest-based test suite covering Facebook token validation, YouTube OAuth flow, and system utilities (40 new tests total)

### Technical Notes
- **Stories API Authentication**: Always use user token (req.headers.authorization) for Directus API calls, never use admin token. User tokens work constantly in the system and have proper permissions for campaign_content collection.
- **Database Storage**: All Stories data should be stored in campaign_content.metadata field as JSON, not in separate fields.
- **Database**: System does not use PostgreSQL - uses Directus as primary database/CMS with external hosted instance.
- **Testing & Scheduler**: DIRECTUS_TOKEN environment variable can be used for:
  - API testing and development scripts
  - Scheduler operations and automated tasks
  - Direct Directus API access when user tokens unavailable
  - Website analysis and other server-side operations
- **Request Processing**: Every user request must be properly self-prompted to ensure complete understanding and systematic execution.
- **DEBUG PHILOSOPHY**: –í–°–ï–ì–î–ê –ò–©–ò–¢–ï –ü–†–û–ë–õ–ï–ú–´ –í –ö–û–î–ï –ü–ï–†–í–£–Æ –û–ß–ï–†–ï–î–¨, –∞ –Ω–µ –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Å–∞—Ö/API. API —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—é—Ç - –∏—â–∏—Ç–µ –±–∞–≥–∏ –≤ –ª–æ–≥–∏–∫–µ, –∫—ç—à–µ, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ–¥–∞. –ü—Ä–æ–º–ø—Ç–∏—Ä—É–π—Ç–µ —Å–µ–±—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫–∞ –±–∞–≥–æ–≤ –≤ –∫–æ–¥–µ.
- **Production Code Quality**: All debug artifacts (console.log statements, UI debug information, temporary development text) must be completely removed before production deployment. System maintains clean, professional interface without any visible debug elements.
- **CRITICAL RECURRING BUGS TO CHECK FIRST**:
  - **Comments API Field Names**: Collection `post_comment` uses field `trent_post_id` (NOT `trend_id`), sorting by `date` (NOT `date_created`)
  - **Comments API Authorization**: Use user token from headers, NOT system token. Check token validity first.
  - **Website Analysis Performance**: extractFullSiteContent functions ALWAYS hang server with regex forEach loops - replace with for loops, 8000ms timeout, 2MB limit
  - **Platform Field Names**: Always verify actual database field names in Directus admin before writing API queries
  - **403 Errors**: Usually wrong field names or collection permissions, NOT authentication issues
- **TOKEN USAGE RULES**:
  - **UI/Frontend**: ALWAYS use user tokens from headers/authorization for ALL user-facing operations
  - **System Operations**: System tokens (DIRECTUS_TOKEN) ONLY for scheduler, automated tasks, and backend operations NOT triggered by user
  - **Mixed Operations**: If API needs both user verification AND system access, verify user token first, then use system token for restricted collections
- **React JSX**: Avoid JSX comments inside conditional renders - use regular JS comments outside JSX or structure conditionals to return valid React elements only.
- **Stories Store Management**: Stories creation through /stories/new route automatically clears localStorage and resets store state. System ensures clean slate for new Stories without old content interference.
- **Stories Navigation**: All Stories creation routes use simple /stories/new path without query parameters. localStorage clearing is handled internally by StoryEditor component.
- **CRITICAL SITE ANALYSIS PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: The extractFullSiteContent functions in server/routes.ts ALWAYS cause server hangs due to regex forEach loops and long HTTP timeouts. When this issue appears:
  1. Find ALL extractFullSiteContent functions (there are multiple)
  2. Replace ALL forEach loops with for loops with Math.min() limits
  3. Set axios timeout to 8000ms MAX, maxContentLength to 2MB
  4. Add content length limits (20KB) with truncation
  5. Never use while loops with regex.exec() - they cause infinite loops
  6. This is a recurring problem that needs immediate fixing when reported
- **REPLIT APPLICATION LOADING TROUBLESHOOTING**: When "app not running" error appears in Replit:
  1. Check server logs for Express startup confirmation on port 5000
  2. Test with static HTML replacement in client/index.html to isolate React vs server issues
  3. Common causes: complex React component imports, logger.ts blocking API calls, circular dependencies
  4. Solution pattern: Use minimal React components, ensure proper error handling in main.tsx
  5. Always verify with curl that server responds with HTTP 200 before debugging frontend

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Content Management**: Directus headless CMS
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Authentication**: Custom token refresh middleware
- **AI Integration**: Gemini (primary), FAL AI Proxy
- **Automation**: N8N workflow automation
- **Deployment**: Docker with Traefik reverse proxy

### Core Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Routes Architecture**: Successfully transitioned from monolithic `routes.ts` to modular system with 5 extracted modules (`auth.ts`, `campaigns.ts`, `keywords.ts`, `trends.ts`, `stories.ts`). Central registration system ensures maintainability while preserving all functionality. LSP errors eliminated completely.
- **N8N-centric Publishing**: All social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, VK, Telegram) publish exclusively through N8N webhooks to ensure consistent architecture and centralized management. No direct API calls from the main application for publishing.
- **Comprehensive Duplicate Prevention**: A 4-level system prevents duplicate posts across platforms using `postUrl` checks, extended caching, a Publication Tracker service, and Lock Manager integration.
- **Intelligent Website Analysis**: A multi-tier fallback system for website analysis uses Gemini AI for content extraction and business questionnaire auto-filling. It prioritizes AI analysis and falls back to intelligent content-based classification if AI services fail.
- **Robust Authentication & Authorization**: JWT token management with automatic refresh and role-based access control (SMM User, SMM Admin). Strict separation of user tokens (for UI) and system tokens (for backend tasks).
- **Social Media API Wizards**: Guided setup wizards (e.g., for Instagram, YouTube, VK) simplify complex API configurations, including OAuth flows and token management, by automating steps and providing clear user guidance.
- **Dynamic Environment Detection**: The system automatically detects development (Replit), staging, and production environments to configure API endpoints and credentials accordingly.
- **Centralized API Key Management**: Global API keys for services like YouTube are stored in the database for centralized administration.
