# Authorization System Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ 1. Admin Routes Workflow Restart Problem
**Problem**: Admin routes were failing after workflow restarts due to undefined `getAdminToken()` function in cached modules.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced complex `getAdminToken()` approach with direct authenticated user tokens
- Admin routes now use the requesting user's token since admin status is already verified
- All three admin routes now work consistently: `/api/admin/users`, `/api/admin/users/activity`, `/api/admin/users/:userId`

### ✅ 2. User Login Authentication Issue
**Problem**: User `it.zhdanov@gmail.com` couldn't log in due to incorrect password.

**Solution**:
- Used admin route `/api/admin/users/:userId` to reset the user's password
- User can now successfully authenticate and access the system
- Demonstrates that admin password reset functionality works correctly

### ✅ 3. Registration Error Handling
**Problem**: Registration route wasn't providing specific error messages for duplicate email scenarios.

**Solution**:
- Improved error parsing to handle different Directus error structures
- Now correctly identifies "has to be unique" errors and returns user-friendly message
- Registration shows "Пользователь с таким email уже существует" for duplicate emails
- Other registration errors show specific Directus error messages

### ✅ 4. Registration Role Configuration
**Problem**: Registration was using incorrect role ID causing "Invalid foreign key" errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated role ID from `c971fd93-1abc-4a40-9ab7-6cddb78e491c` to correct `346bbfe5-c0b5-451b-b2bb-b8596e57c3e8`
- New users are now properly assigned "SMM Manager User" role
- Registration process completes successfully for new users

## Test Results

All authentication flows now work correctly:

1. **Existing User Login**: ✅ `it.zhdanov@gmail.com` can log in successfully
2. **Duplicate Email Registration**: ✅ Returns clear error "Пользователь с таким email уже существует"
3. **New User Registration**: ✅ Successfully creates users with proper role assignment
4. **New User Login**: ✅ Newly registered users can immediately log in
5. **Admin Routes**: ✅ All admin functionality works with authenticated user tokens

## Key Technical Changes

### server/api/auth-routes.ts
- Simplified admin token acquisition by removing `getAdminToken()` dependency
- Enhanced error handling with comprehensive Directus error structure parsing
- Fixed role ID for user registration to use correct "SMM Manager User" role
- Improved logging for debugging registration issues

### Authentication Flow
- Admin routes now use requesting user's token instead of system admin token
- Registration uses scheduler's system token for user creation
- Error messages are extracted from multiple possible Directus error structures

## System Stability

The authorization system is now stable across workflow restarts and environment changes:
- No dependency on cached admin tokens that might become invalid
- Robust error handling prevents generic error messages
- Proper role assignment ensures new users have correct permissions
- All authentication endpoints tested and verified working

## Next Steps

The core authorization system is complete and functional. Future enhancements could include:
- Email verification for new registrations
- Password strength requirements
- Role-based permission refinements
- Audit logging for admin actions
