What you need to know
Key changes:

New GA Endpoints: New GA endpoints for Gemini 2.5 Flash (gemini-2.5-flash) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (gemini-2.5-pro) are now available (effective June 17, 2025). We’ve removed the “-001” suffix, which was previously used to indicate a stable version.
For more information, refer to the (Gemini 2.5 Flash documentation).
Preview Endpoint Availability and Removal: All existing Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro preview endpoints (listed below) will continue to be available with their current preview pricing until July 15, 2025. After this date, these preview endpoints will be shut down.

gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25

Updated Preview Endpoints: Effective June 19, 2025, gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 endpoint will serve the Gemini 2.5 Flash model version released on 05-20, which has been promoted to GA. Similarly, the gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 and 03-25 endpoints will serve the Gemini 2.5 Pro model version released on 06-05, also promoted to GA. This update ensures continuity during your transition.
Updated Pricing for Gemini 2.5 Flash GA: The price for Gemini 2.5 Flash in GA will be adjusted to reflect its quality and unified output token pricing. This includes lower prices for “thinking” output, higher prices for “non-thinking” output, and ongoing service enhancements. These pricing changes will take effect on the new GA endpoint as shared above. Preview pricing will only continue on existing preview endpoints for 30 days post-GA on July 15, 2025.
Refer to the table below for details.

Provisioned Throughput (PT): Once the product is GA, all new PT purchases will be for GA endpoints only.
If you’ve purchased PT for a specific preview version, It will still work for that specific preview.
However, you must migrate the existing PT to the GA endpoint or purchase new PT for the GA endpoint by July 15, 2025.
